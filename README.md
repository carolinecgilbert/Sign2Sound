- Create a new environment, myenv, from environment.yml dependencies
'conda create --name myenv --file environment.yml' 
- Activate environment
'conda activate myenv'
- After finishing work in environment, deactivate it
'conda deactivate'
- Delete environment if needed
'conda remove -n myenv --all'
