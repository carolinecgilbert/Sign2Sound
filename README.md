### PCA Jupyter Notebook Instructions
Use a virtual environment to install required dependencies for the jupyter notebook.

See [Virtual Environment Dependencies](pca-test/environment.yml)

Navigate to the pca-test folder and run the following commands to activate a virtual environment on Anaconda to install and run the notebook:
- Create a new virtual environment `myenv` from the [environment.yml](pca-test/environment.yml) dependencies:

    ```
    conda create --name myenv --file environment.yml
    ```

- Activate the environment:
    ```
    conda activate myenv
    ```

- After finishing work in environment, deactivate it
    ```
    conda deactivate
    ```
- Delete environment if needed
    ```
    conda remove -n myenv --all
    ```
